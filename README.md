# MX50-Visual-patch-guide
Printed guide for Panasonic WJ-MX50A

This is a print design, made for "saving" a setup using the Panasonic WJ-MX50A video mixer.
The print is designed to be a visual representation of the physical machine, more or less, 
for taking notes of a certain state of inputs and button/knob/slider states.
I have omitted the display section, and made a direct representation of both A and B effect button rows.
I added notes for buttons that are not only "on/off", e.g. wipes and borders that have multipe states.
There's also an input/output section that allows you to take not of what goes in and out of the machine.

You are free to add to this design.
